# GcodeThumbnailExtension

This library is a Windows Explorer Shell Extension intended to show thumbnails of gcode files generated by PrusaSlicer

## Installation
Download the zip from releases, extract the contents and run the register.bat file.
It will register the shell extension from local path (so do not (re)move the extension dll after without unregistering)

## Release notes

### v1.0
Features
- When you open a folder containging a gcode file with embedded thumbnails, it should show them the way jpg and other images get rendered
- Works with the base64-encoded png that newer versions of PrusaSlicer generate and the PrusaMini display shows

Limitations
- only 1000 lines of the gcode are scanned to find the start of the thumbnail data, but currently the thumbnails seem to be placed at the start of the file so that should not be a problem
- if the file contains multiple thumbnails, the last one is used - the slicer seems to embedd multiple (well, two at least from my test) resolutions and the first one was really tiny
